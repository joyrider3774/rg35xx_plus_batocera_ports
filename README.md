Builds of my games running on rg35xx plus / h Batocera CFW

## Installing
In general on the rg35xx plus running Batocera Custom Firmware.
Extract the zips you download from the [Release Section](https://github.com/joyrider3774/rg35xx_plus_batocera_ports/releases) in the `roms/ports` folder.
For example if you open `checkers - RG35XX_Plus_Batocera_cfw.zip` there will be a folder inside, in this example named
`checkers` and an sh file named `Checkers.sh` you need to copy that folder to the `roms/ports` folder of your rg35xx plus Batocera Custom Firmware.
there is also an `images` folder included with 2 images per game, one for the logo and one screenshot. You need to edit the games metadata manually
and select the images in order to view them.
The playdate games will start up in 1 bit graphics mode, meaning black and white. To switch to the colored graphics press the `X` button. The game
will rebooot and use colored graphics and remember this for the next time you start the game. Some games have multiple graphic options like `Waternet`
and `Puztrix` if you press `X` again you will cycle through all the available options, each time restarting the game.
